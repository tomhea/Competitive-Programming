Short Explanation:
I used a segment tree to save for every number - the number of occurances it has.
The tree is a max-tree, as it saves for every subtree the maximal value of its nodes.,
 i.e. the maximal number of occurances it has between its end-nodes.
Then for every query, i removed some occurances from the end-nodes as the query suggest, 
  searched the tree for maximal occurances bwtween the end-nodes, and then added the removed occurances back.
Time Complexity: O((n+q)log(n)).
