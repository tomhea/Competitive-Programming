Short Explanation:
I created a graph of the abc letters as nodes and their translations as edges.
A translation is correct if for every corresponding letters in the translation there is a path from the first to the second. i.e. bfs(first, second) return true;
Time Complexity: O(m*n) - m = number of translations of letters, n = number of words translations checks.
