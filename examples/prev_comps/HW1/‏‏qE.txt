Short Explanation:
The action of adding the left and the right should happen S times, so I looked at it as the adding matrix, to the power of S.
matrix multiplication takes time.. so because its a rotational matrix, i used the n^2 rot-matrix multiplication.
together with the fast exponentiation, it became runnable. after that we multiply the given starting numbers with the calculated matrix, to get the result.
Time Complexity: O(n^2 * log(S)).
