Short Explanation:
In case that the missing opcode is a rotation -
    I brute-forced all 360 angles, executed the Logo program with it,
    and printed the one which the turtle finishes on (0,0).
In case that the missing opcode is a movement -
    I executed all of the opcodes but the missing one,
    and printed the distance between the place I got and (0,0) - that's the missing number.
Time Complexity: O(n), with n = number of opcodes.
