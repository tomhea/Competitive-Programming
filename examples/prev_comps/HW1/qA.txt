Short Explanation:
I insert every event to a priority queue, as 2 events - start-time and end-time. 
I pop every event and checks if it collides with the last ones.
repeating events are handelned with inserting them again with time += jump-size.
Time Complexity: O(nlog(n) * 1000000), with 1000000 = jump-size.
