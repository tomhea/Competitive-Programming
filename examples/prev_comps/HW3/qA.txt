Short Explanation:
I created the matrix representing R[i,j] = 1 iff there is a 1-row-play from state i to state j.
The matrix is 35*35, for the 35 different placements of 4 players in a 7-cell board.
I pre-calculated the matrix, and then checked how many different routes are there using matrix power.
The matrix line that represents the starting placement, has the number of different routes, on each reasonable placement.
Sum them all to get the answer (of course, all modulo 1000000007).
Time Complexity: O(log(N) * 35^3), with 35^3 = matrix manipulation complexity.
