Short Explanation:
I created a weighted graph representing the options of going up/down/switch elevators.
The nodes are [100*i -> 100*i + 99] for each 100 floors while riding on elevator i.
Then, I added a starting node connected to each elevator at floor 0 with zero cost,
 and end node reachable from the k'th floor of each elevator with zero cost.
Then I connected all the stoppable floors of each elevator with the cost of travelling up or down with the ride cost,
 and lastly I connected all the elevators stopping at the same floor with cost of 60 seconds.
Afterwards I run the Dijkstra algorithm (E*logV) from node s, and printed the result according to the distance to node e.
Time Complexity: O((100V)^2 * log(100V)).
