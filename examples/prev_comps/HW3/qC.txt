Short Explanation:
I created a weighted graph representing the circles and the walls.
The nodes are the circles and the walls, and the weights between two nodes is the maximal circle diameter that can go between them.
Afterwards I run the Dijkstra algorithm (E*logV) from the left wall, and printed the result according to the distance to the right wall.
 The Dijkstra algorithm was changed a bit, so that the cost of a route is the weight of the heaviest edge on that route.
Time Complexity: O(n^2 * log(n)).
